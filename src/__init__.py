L21 - Iris Classification using Naive Bayes: Comparative Implementation Study

This package implements Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier in two ways:
1. Manual implementation using NumPy from scratch
2. Using scikit-learn's GaussianNB

The implementations are compared across multiple dimensions:
- Runtime performance (training and prediction)
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Learned parameters (priors, means, variances)
- Prediction agreement rate
